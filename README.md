# Processor Architecture Course Projects

Welcome to my repository for the Processor Architecture course at Polytechnique Montreal. This repository contains the projects I completed as part of this course, which involved learning and applying various concepts in C and Assembly language.

## Projects Overview

### TP0: Introduction to the C Language

The first project focused on getting acquainted with the C programming language. It covered the basics, including syntax, data types, control structures, and functions.

### TP1: Introduction to Assembly

The second project introduced us to Assembly language. We learned about the fundamentals of assembly programming, including instruction sets, registers, and basic operations.

### TP2: Assembly Exercises

In the third project, we tackled a series of exercises designed to deepen our understanding of Assembly language. These exercises involved writing and debugging assembly code to perform various tasks.

### TP3: Implementation of Algorithms in Assembly

The fourth project involved implementing algorithms in Assembly language. We applied our knowledge from previous projects to write efficient and optimized assembly code for various algorithms.
